      <h2 class="policy-title">Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p class="policy-intro">At HomeVue, we take the privacy and security of your data seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard the information we gather from users of our interior design visualization app. By using HomeVue, you agree to the terms and practices described in this policy.</p>

      <div id="data-collection" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>HomeVue collects the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you choose to create an account, we collect your email address and an encrypted version of your password. You may also provide optional profile information such as your name and design preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Room Data:</strong> When you scan a room, we collect spatial mapping data, which includes dimensions and layouts of your space. This information is used to create accurate 3D models for furniture placement and is stored locally on your device only.</li>
          <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic information about your device type, operating system version, and hardware capabilities is collected to optimize app performance and ensure compatibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous, aggregated data about how you use the app, such as which features you access most frequently and general usage patterns. This helps us improve the app's functionality and user experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect or store actual photographic images or videos of your home, though the app requires camera access to function properly. All spatial data is abstracted and does not include identifiable details of your living space beyond what is necessary for the app's core functionality.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="data-usage" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>2. How We Use Your Data</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Providing Core Services:</strong> We use the collected data primarily to deliver the core functions of HomeVue, including room scanning, furniture placement, and design saving.</li>
          <li><strong>Account Management:</strong> For users with accounts, we use email addresses for authentication, password recovery, and sending important service updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Design Storage and Sharing:</strong> If you choose to save or share room designs, we store the necessary data to enable these features, including furniture selections, placement coordinates, and room dimensions.</li>
          <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> Anonymous usage data helps us understand how people interact with HomeVue, allowing us to enhance existing features and develop new ones based on user needs.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="data-storage" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>3. Local vs. Cloud Storage</h3>
        <p>HomeVue implements a privacy-focused approach to data storage:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All room scan data, including 3D meshes and spatial information, is stored exclusively on your local device. Your room designs, including furniture placement information, are also stored locally.</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Our furniture 3D models are stored in the cloud and downloaded to your device when needed. If you choose to share a design, only the minimal necessary data about your design is uploaded to our servers to facilitate sharing.</li>
          <li><strong>User Account Data:</strong> If you create an account, your authentication information is stored securely in our cloud database. This allows you to access your account across different devices.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="camera-access" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>4. Camera and Photo Library Access</h3>
        <p>HomeVue requires access to your device's camera to enable AR functionality for scanning rooms and placing furniture. Additionally, the app requests photo library access to save images of your designs when you choose to export them. These permissions are essential for core app functionality but can be managed in your device settings at any time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Camera Processing:</strong> All camera processing for AR functionality happens locally on your device. Live camera feed is not recorded or transmitted to our servers.</li>
          <li><strong>Photo Saving:</strong> When you choose to save a design image to your photo library, this action occurs locally on your device after you provide explicit permission.</li>
          <li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> You can review and manage all app permissions through your device's Settings app at any time.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="data-security" class="privacy-block fade-in">
        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> All data transferred between your device and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols. Stored data is protected using AES-256 encryption.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> User authentication is handled through secure methods with password hashing and salting to ensure credentials remain protected.</li>
          <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct periodic security assessments of our systems and update our practices to address emerging threats.</li>
        </ul>
